        System Overview
    </h2>

    <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed font-medium">
        This project explores sentiment inference in low-resource, short-form social media text, 
        where meaning is frequently compressed into symbolic cues. In these contexts, emojis 
        function as high-signal <strong>affective amplifiers</strong> that can reinforce, 
        soften, or redefine textual intent.
    </p>

    <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
        Rather than treating emojis as noise, the system implements <strong>auxiliary feature 
        engineering</strong>. By extracting symbolic polarity and joining it with TF-IDF textual 
        representations, the pipeline enables the classifier to evaluate linguistic and symbolic 
        sentiment channels simultaneously.

    <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
        The workflow encompasses the full data science lifecycle: deterministic cleaning, 
        exploratory signal analysis, feature fusion, and interpretability diagnostics. 
        Each stage produces <strong>immutable artifacts</strong>—from validated datasets to 
        serialized modeling states—ensuring transparency and parity between training and inference.

        The sections below document this progression, surfacing the empirical insights and 
        architectural decisions that power the live sentiment analysis interface.
