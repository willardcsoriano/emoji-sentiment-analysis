        System Overview
    </h2>

<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
    This project explores how sentiment can be inferred from short-form social media text,
    where meaning is often compressed, informal, and heavily shaped by emojis. In these
    contexts, emojis act not as decorative elements but as semantic signals that can reinforce,
    soften, or even invert textual intent.
</p>

<p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
    Rather than filtering emojis out or treating them as isolated tokens, the system integrates
    emoji-aware feature engineering into a structured natural language processing workflow.
    Textual representations and emoji features are modeled jointly, enabling the classifier to
    learn sentiment patterns that emerge from their interaction.
</p>

<p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
    The pipeline spans data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature construction,
    model training, interpretability analysis, and reproducible inference. Each stage produces
    traceable artifacts—from processed datasets to trained vectorizers and models—supporting
    transparency, evaluation, and operational monitoring.
</p>

<p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
    The sections below walk through this workflow step by step, presenting intermediate outputs,
    evaluation insights, and the production assets that power the live sentiment inference
    interface above.
