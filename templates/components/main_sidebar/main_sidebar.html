<!--
Main Sidebar Container

Layout role:
- Secondary column within the primary workspace grid.
- Sits adjacent to the R&D pipeline visualization.

Pipeline relationship:
- Provides contextual artifacts that complement the active pipeline stages.
- Surfaces system metadata rather than step-by-step narrative.

Typical contents:
- Model specifications
- Dataset summaries
- Evaluation metrics
- Artifact references
- System diagnostics

Layout behavior:
- Sticky on large screens for persistent visibility.
- Scroll-independent from the main pipeline column.
- Collapses into full-width flow on mobile.

Design principles:
- Informational, not interactive-heavy.
- Quick-reference surfaces vs deep exploration panels.
