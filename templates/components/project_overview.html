        Project Overview
    </h2>

    <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        This project examines how emotional intent can be inferred from short-form text in cases
        where conventional sentiment cues are sparse, ambiguous, or shaped by informal language.
        A particular emphasis is placed on emojis as semantic amplifiers rather than decorative
        noise.
    </p>

    <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
        Instead of treating emojis as isolated tokens or filtering them out entirely, the system
        incorporates emoji-aware feature engineering into a structured sentiment analysis workflow.
        Each stage—from data ingestion to model inference—is designed to remain transparent,
        reproducible, and grounded in exploratory analysis.
    </p>

    <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
        The sections below present this workflow step by step, alongside intermediate artifacts,
        evaluation results, and the trained models that power the live inference interface above.
