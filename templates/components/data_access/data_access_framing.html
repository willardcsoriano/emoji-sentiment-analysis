<!--
Data Access — Framing Panel
Introduces dataset scope, constraints, and engineering implications.

Pipeline position:
- Precedes schema + download artifacts.
- Provides methodological context before raw data inspection.

Objectives:
- Explain why the dataset is intentionally small.
- Justify modeling strategy choices.
- Frame emoji + text fusion as a core engineering problem.

Design principles:
- Narrative-first (research tone vs UI instruction).
- Compact container to maintain readability.
- Glassmorphism styling distinguishes it from tabular data blocks.

    Dataset size constraint explanation

    Communicates:
    - ~1k sample limitation
    - Interpretability > scale tradeoff
    - Suitability of linear vs deep models
    -->
    <p class="text-[11px] text-slate-500 leading-relaxed italic mt-3">
        The dataset is intentionally limited to approximately 1,000 labeled samples.
        This constraint prioritizes interpretability and rapid iteration over raw
        performance, making classical linear models and feature-weighted approaches
        more reliable than high-capacity neural architectures in this context.

    Multi-source ingestion framing

    Highlights:
    - Linguistic vs symbolic sentiment channels
    - Structural incompatibility of datasets
    - Fusion as a feature engineering challenge
    -->
    <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
        Sentiment is not expressed through language alone. This system ingests
        two structurally incompatible datasets to capture both linguistic
        sentiment and symbolic emotional signals. The primary engineering
        challenge lies in unifying these sources without introducing bias or
        information loss.
