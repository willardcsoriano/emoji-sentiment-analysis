<!--
Data Access — Framing Panel
Introduces dataset scope, constraints, and engineering implications.

Pipeline position:
- Precedes schema + download artifacts.
- Provides methodological context before raw data inspection.

Objectives:
- Explain why the dataset is intentionally small.
- Justify modeling strategy choices.
- Frame emoji + text fusion as a core engineering problem.

Design principles:
- Narrative-first (research tone vs UI instruction).
- Compact container to maintain readability.
- Glassmorphism styling distinguishes it from tabular data blocks.

            The supervised training corpus consists of a compact set of labeled emoji-bearing tweets, 
            complemented by a structured emoticon reference dataset. While modest in scale, this 
            composition supports rapid iteration, transparent evaluation, and feature-level 
            interpretability—making classical linear modeling approaches well-suited to the signal
             density and sparsity characteristics of the data.

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 leading-relaxed"> 
            Sentiment in short-form social media text is expressed through both linguistic content 
            and symbolic cues. To capture this dual channel, the pipeline ingests structurally 
            distinct datasets: free-text tweets and normalized emoji/emoticon sentiment references. 
            A central engineering challenge lies in reconciling these modalities into a unified 
            feature space without distorting their respective semantic contributions.
