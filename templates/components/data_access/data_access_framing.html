        The dataset is intentionally limited to approximately 1,000 labeled samples.
        This constraint prioritizes interpretability and rapid iteration over raw
        performance, making classical linear models and feature-weighted approaches
        more reliable than high-capacity neural architectures in this context.

        Sentiment is not expressed through language alone. This system ingests
        two structurally incompatible datasets to capture both linguistic
        sentiment and symbolic emotional signals. The primary engineering
        challenge lies in unifying these sources without introducing bias or
        information loss.
