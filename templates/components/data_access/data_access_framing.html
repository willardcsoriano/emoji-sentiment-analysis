<!--
Data Access — Framing Panel
Introduces dataset scope, constraints, and engineering implications.

Pipeline position:
- Precedes schema + download artifacts.
- Provides methodological context before raw data inspection.

Objectives:
- Explain why the dataset is intentionally small.
- Justify modeling strategy choices.
- Frame emoji + text fusion as a core engineering problem.

Design principles:
- Narrative-first (research tone vs UI instruction).
- Compact container to maintain readability.
- Glassmorphism styling distinguishes it from tabular data blocks.

            <strong>Note on Scale:</strong> This pipeline operates in a 
            <em>low-resource environment</em>, utilizing a compact training corpus of 1,000 
            labeled tweets. While modest in scale, this constraint necessitates a focus on 
            <strong>feature density</strong> and <strong>model interpretability</strong>—making 
            linear classification an optimal choice to prevent overfitting while maintaining 
            high predictive transparency.

        The core engineering objective is the fusion of dual-channel sentiment signals: 
        linguistic text and symbolic emojis. By reconciling these distinct modalities 
        into a unified feature space, the system captures emotional nuance that is 
        frequently lost in standard tokenization pipelines—proving that even at a 
        1k-sample scale, targeted feature engineering can drive significant performance gains.
