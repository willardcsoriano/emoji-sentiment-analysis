<!--
Data Access — Methodological Justification Panel

Purpose:
- Explains the engineering necessity of dataset unification.
- Serves as the conceptual bridge between ingestion and feature engineering.

Pipeline position:
- Final block within the Data Access layer.
- Precedes feature construction and representation modeling.

Objectives:
- Justify schema normalization work.
- Highlight risks of ignoring symbolic sentiment.
- Reinforce interpretability + signal preservation goals.

Design note:
- Dark container visually distinguishes rationale from data artifacts.
- Functions as an “engineering insight” callout rather than documentation table.

            Unification rationale narrative

            Key concepts:
            - Schema alignment
            - Symbolic normalization
            - Feature space projection
            - Classifier stability preservation

                Emoji sentiment is frequently embedded within tweet text but can be diluted or lost during conventional 
                text vectorization. This engineering step preserves symbolic affect (emotional expression) by detecting emojis and referencing 
                a polarity lexicon to derive auxiliary sentiment signals. By augmenting textual features with 
                emoji-informed context, the pipeline retains emotional nuance while maintaining model interpretability 
                and stability.
