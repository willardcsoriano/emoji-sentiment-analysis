<!--
Data Access — Methodological Justification Panel

Purpose:
- Explains the engineering necessity of dataset unification.
- Serves as the conceptual bridge between ingestion and feature engineering.

Pipeline position:
- Final block within the Data Access layer.
- Precedes feature construction and representation modeling.

Objectives:
- Justify schema normalization work.
- Highlight risks of ignoring symbolic sentiment.
- Reinforce interpretability + signal preservation goals.

Design note:
- Dark container visually distinguishes rationale from data artifacts.
- Functions as an “engineering insight” callout rather than documentation table.

            Unification rationale narrative

            Key concepts:
            - Schema alignment
            - Symbolic normalization
            - Feature space projection
            - Classifier stability preservation

                Without schema unification, emoji-driven sentiment would be
                underrepresented or discarded entirely. The ingestion pipeline
                removes redundant indices, normalizes symbolic inputs, and
                projects both datasets into a shared feature space — preserving
                affect signal while maintaining classifier stability.
