<!--
Data Access Page Component
Centralized entry point for dataset transparency, inspection, and retrieval.

Pipeline position:
- Maps to "Data Sources" + "Data Ingestion & Exploration" stages.
- Provides visibility into raw and processed corpora used in modeling.

Objectives:
- Support reproducibility and auditability.
- Allow users to inspect training inputs.
- Surface schema + structural context before feature engineering.

Design principles:
- Modular subcomponents separate narrative, downloads, and previews.
- Read-only presentation (no mutation of source data).
- Optimized for exploratory browsing, not bulk data tooling.

    Framing narrative

    Introduces:
    - Dataset origin
    - Sentiment labeling context
    - Emoji inclusion rationale

    {% include "components/data_access/data_access_framing.html" %}

    <!--
    Download access panel

    Provides:
    - Direct dataset retrieval
    - Versioned artifacts
    - Reproducibility support for external reviewers

    <!--
    Dataset preview grid

    Purpose:
    - Provide tangible inspection of source records.
    - Bridge abstract schema → real examples.
    - Highlight emoji + text co-occurrence patterns.

    Layout:
    - Single column stack (mobile + desktop for readability).
